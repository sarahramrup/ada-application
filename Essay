### Essay Questions

1. My professional passions consist of building new things, optimizing existing spaces, and collaborating with teams to develop fresh ideas. Thus far in my professional experience, I have sought out opportunities that would lend itself to accomplishing those three main objectives, and this is why I feel that programming is the next step for my career. I’ve worked in Digital Business on the data side of eCommerce, within the rules and structures of development. I would like to be the person (and a part of the team) that builds that infrastructure - finding efficiencies and ensuring sound business process along the way. To expose myself to programming, I have participated in free community resources in St. Louis, specifically taking a course called “Hello, World” which is an introduction to programming. I’ve also completed several modules of CS50x and a few JavaScript lessons from Code Academy. Moreover, I have spoken to developers in my department and stayed up to date on tickets regarding development efforts that affect my work, for example: how the WebSphere Commerce FEP8 Upgrade affects data rules, testing tags to capture merchandising analytics in Core Metrics, and working with the PIM development team to implement an import file I designed.

2. In the next two years, I hope to work for a company in development to continue to gain skills in technology, efficiency, and business process. I thrive in environments where there are multiple needs to accommodate and opportunities to create something of my own. Knowing data structures and requirements is experience that will be an asset for any company in development work. Within the next five years, I hope to become a consultant. Moving multiple times across the U.S. and Canada has enabled me to quickly get to know others and become comfortable in new environments. That being said, I love working on projects and with different people, so consulting would be an excellent fit for my interests!

3. Every year I make a timeline for myself of professional and personal goals. In 2015, a goal was to find an employable outlet for my creativity. Since my girlfriend and I are usually hosting events, I had experience with amateur bartending. I decided to take this a step further and enroll in a bartending program. Upon obtaining my certification, I was bursting with knowledge and excitement so much so that I applied everywhere, even places that had limited opportunities for creativity. Because I casted such a large net, the first positions I heard back from were not necessarily the best positions available. I instantly accepted an offer at a dine-in movie theater where it was clear while training that I wouldn’t have the creative expression that I got into bartending for in the first place. Looking back, I wish that I had been more mindful of my motivations for getting into bartending and held off on accepting an offer until I determined the best fit for my interests and talents. Just a few weeks later, I was offered a bartender position with one of the best venues in St. Louis, specifically to create custom cocktails for private events.

4. One of the greatest skills I taught myself was how to use Microsoft Access. When I first started at Graybar, I relied on requesting reports from others. Since I needed some reports daily, it was obvious that this limited my self-sufficiency as an analyst. I started learning by watching Youtube tutorials for simpler reports. For more extensive reporting, I asked for help from a few of the Access savvy members of my team. In my team, I am responsible for pushing batches of SKUs to go live as commerce and data requirements are confirmed.  After a few waves of SKUs, I recognized the need for a collaborative master list that would serve as the one stop resource for all products on graybar.com. Building upon my experience with Access, I developed my first database designed to simplify the stages of a product’s lifecycle for my product data team. This database has since been adopted as the master list for all teams within Digital Business.
